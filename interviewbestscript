To ensure that candidates stay focused and concise in their responses, you can set this expectation clearly at the beginning of the interview. Here’s a revised script that includes this guidance:

---

**Introduction:**

"Good [morning/afternoon], and thank you for joining us today. My name is [Your Name], and I’m part of the [Cloud Operations/Site Reliability Engineering] team here at [Company]. We’re excited to have you interview for the [Cloud Operations Specialist/Site Reliability Engineer] position.

Before we start, I’d like to introduce the panel members who are joining us today: [Panelist 1 name, Panelist 2 name, etc.]. Each of us will be asking you questions throughout the interview, and we will rotate between panelists as we progress."

---

**Setting Expectations:**

"We’d like to cover a variety of topics today, so it’s important that we make the best use of our time together. To help with that, we ask that you keep your responses focused and concise. If we need more detail on a particular answer, we’ll be sure to follow up with additional questions. 

This will help ensure we cover all the important areas during the interview and give you the opportunity to demonstrate your full range of skills."

**Interview Process:**

"As we go through the interview, each panelist will take turns asking questions. After each round, you’ll have time to respond. We appreciate concise and to-the-point answers, but feel free to ask for clarification if needed. If you need to take a moment to think through a response, that’s completely fine.

We’ll be asking about your experience with cloud infrastructure, automation, reliability, and incident management, among other topics. We aim to cover as much ground as possible, so your cooperation in keeping answers brief but informative will be very helpful."

**Closing Remarks:**

"After the interview, we’ll leave time for you to ask any questions you may have about the role, our team, or the company. We’re eager to learn more about you and hear how you would contribute to the success of the team."

---

**Transition to the Interview:**

"With that, we’ll go ahead and get started. [Panelist 1], you can take it from here."

By setting the expectation for concise and focused answers upfront, you establish clear boundaries for the candidate while ensuring they understand that you will guide the conversation if more detail is needed.
